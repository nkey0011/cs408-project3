# cs408-project3
The final project for App Development. 
This project is a Memopad application. 
There is an input text field, a POST button, a CLEAR button, and an output field.
The user inputs the note they would like to add to Memopad and selects the post button. 
This invokes a post request and sends the new note to the output field and assigns a chronological number. 
Previous notes are also retrieved from the post request and displayed in the order they were posted.
The CLEAR button invokes a delete method and removes the notes from the output field and the server.
